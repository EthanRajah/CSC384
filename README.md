# CSC384 - AI

Code solutions for assignments in CSC384 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. These assignments require implementations of search algorithms such as A*, iterative deepening search, minimax and backtracking search. Game theory and constrained satisfaction problems are introduced, requiring implementations of other algorithms such as forward checking and arc-consistency. The final assignment deals with bayesian approaches for likelihood estimation, which introduces algorithms such as hidden Markov models and the Viterbi algorithm.
